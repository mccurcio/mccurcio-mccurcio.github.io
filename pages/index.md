## Welcome 

- I am a Scientist and an Educator, and I can bridge multiple disciplines.   

- I am inquisitive and now use the tools of Statistics, Data Science, R, and Python. 

### This is my Data Science Study Site

![](/assets/img/left-arrow-red2.jpg) On the left, you will find a list of my work and articles I am rewriting. 

I have several goals for this site.

1. This site is meant to store my coding information and snippets. I call it my Info-Archive

Feel free to browse my:

- [Info-Archive by title](https://mccurcio.github.io/archive/)
- [Info-Archive by tags](https://mccurcio.github.io/tags/)

>Please note that I am migrating and condensing my work right now. 

As an aside, I am a huge fan of Chris Albon's work and [website](https://chrisalbon.com). On his site, he has collected his code snippets in Python. 

2. I am in the process of rewriting the material I wrote when teaching myself Data Science and Analytics. It is very formal (like me at times), and I strive to make the work more appealing to my friends and fellow students.
