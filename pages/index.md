## MC's Python/R/Bash/Linux Information Site

The goals for this site:

1. Share my learning journey via
   - [Articles](docs)
   - [Presentations](docs/mcc-presentations)
   - [Posts by title](archive)

2. Answers the question 'What I have learned today?' This is my store house of notes/snippets. 
   - It may seem like I do not learn something everyday. But that's not true. I may not remember it in time to write it down. 😉

## Have a Question?
