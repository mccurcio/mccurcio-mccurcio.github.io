## MC's Python/R/Bash/Linux Information Site

The goals for this site:

1. Share my learning journey via
   - [Articles](docs)
   - [Presentations](docs/mcc-presentations)
   - [Posts by title](archive)

2. Answers the question "*What have I learned today?"*  
   - My notes/snippets. 
   - It may seem like I don't learn something everyday, but that's not true. I may not remember it in time to write it down. 😉
