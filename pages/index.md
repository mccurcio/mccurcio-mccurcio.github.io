# Welcome to my Data Science study site 

**My goals for this site are to**:

1. Present my Articles, Presentations, and Posts on Data Science, *Obiviously* 
2. Share my posts that include code snippets I have used, and my coding help and notes
   - I got inspiration from of Chris Albon's [website](https://chrisalbon.com), Thanks Chris 👏
3. Spur discussion and interactivity. 
   - Thanks to [VSoch](https://vsoch.github.io/docsy-jekyll/) for designing the Docsy-Jekyll theme 👏

**Feel free to browse my**:

- ⬅️ Articles
- [Posts by title](https://mccurcio.github.io/archive/)
- [Posts by tags](https://mccurcio.github.io/tags/)

I am in the process of migrating and rewriting my older material.  

*Oddly, I used writing to teach myself. My writing is a little formal (like myself at times), BUT I am striving to make it appealing*. 😉
