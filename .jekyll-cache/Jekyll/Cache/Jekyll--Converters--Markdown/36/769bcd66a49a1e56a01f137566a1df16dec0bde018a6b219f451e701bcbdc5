<p>Burden of Proof</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That which can be asserted with out evidence can be dismissed without evidence.<br />
The burden of proof is on the claimant.<br />
If the claimant makes a claim it is up to that person to prove it.</p>

  <p>Christopher Hitchens, 13 April 1949 â€“ 15 December 2011</p>
