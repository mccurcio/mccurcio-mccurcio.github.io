## A Tiddlywiki, What?

> A non-linear web notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.

Briefly--

<abbr title="Tiddlywiki">TW</abbr>  is a:

1. Note taking, 
2. Picture storing,
3. Document storing,
4. Journaling,
5. Search enabled,
6. Tag managed,

and an *information-storage-software* written in Javascript used with your web browser. 

- It's a free, and open-source. 
- It runs locally on a network.
- It can be made private.

I love it because it can be stored on a thumb drive or ON Google Drive and keeps everything together in one place not multiple markdown (*.md) files. 

**It is my favorite note taking platform.**

I will admit that this software has not cured me of keeping notes, pictures, etc, in every hiding place possible, but I am one step closer to storing it in one place.


##  Step 1 - Download a <abbr title="Tiddlywiki">TW</abbr>

- Download your own *Tiddlywiki* .html 'doc': [Tiddlywiki.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

- Add your **Title** & **Subtitle**.
    - Both show on the top-right-hand side.
</br>   
 - Close the tiddler by using the **X**. 
 - Then **Save** By pressing the RED circled-checkmark.

## Step #3 - Write a Note

Change the titles and you can *start writing immediately*.

- Press the **Grey Plus Sign** below your titles, to OPEN your first note ([Tiddler](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Tiddlers.html)).

The `New Tiddler` window has 4 areas that are the most useful:

1. The Title,
1. The Tag Name,
1. The Text Editor,
1. The Control Buttons (trash-can, x and the chekmark)

>CAUTION: Tiddlywiki uses its own variation of Markdown so try the Editor tools to help you get used to the changes.

Add you title, note, and choose a good tag name and you are all set. 

- Click the Grey Checkmark to accept your note.

- Click RED checkmark on the far-right and save your work.

>But if you make a mistake, use the trash-can to delete.

**Those are the basics**. 

Now you are ready to dive in.
