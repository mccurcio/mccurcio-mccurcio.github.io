Their is one online bookstore I visit quite often, <a href="https://leanpub.com/" target="_blank">LeanPub.com</a>.  

LeanPub allows one to write in **Markdown**. This version of markdown varies from GitHub markdown so becareful, but that is minor. Being an R enthusiast, their are many books on R and Data Science.

For the beginner you can find many **FREE** titles: 

- [R Programming for Data Science by Roger Peng]()
- [Interpretable Machine Learning (Second Edition) by Christoph Molnar]()
- [Introductory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences]()
- <a href="https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics" target="_blank">OpenIntro Statistics</a>
- <a href="https://leanpub.com/datasciencebook" target="_blank">Introduction to Data Science by Rafael Irizarry</a>
- <a href="https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook" target="_blank">Statistical Inference for D.S.</a>
- <a href="https://leanpub.com/tidyverseskillsdatascience" target="_blank">Tidyverse Skills for Data Science in R, with some great illustrations</a>


Great books from *Jeff Leek* or *Roger Peng* from Johns Hopkins Uni. for free. Jeff Leek and Roger Peng are Bioinformatics gurus and teach data science. Roger has a Stats/Science podcast too called <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/interviews/" target="_blank">Simplystatistics</a>.

Books on <a href="https://leanpub.com/datastyle" target="_blank">Elements of Data Analytic Style</a> and <a href="https://leanpub.com/rprogramming" target="_blank">R Programming for Data Science by Roger Peng</a>. and even <a href="https://leanpub.com/pytorch" target="_blank">machine learning</a>
This publisher has become *The Technical bookstore* stop. 


I am able to write Markdown docs then RMarkdown scientific notebooks inside RStudio IDE and present nice text as well as Latex or mathematical formulas. There is cool series of books using the Prefix "JUST ENOUGH". So you can find How to write books and publish on Leanpub.com, for example, <a href="https://leanpub.com/jeco-authoring" target="_blank">Just Enough Co-Authoring in Leanpub</a>

**I highly recommend Leanpub.com**
