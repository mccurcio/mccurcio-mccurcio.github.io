Find differences between archive and file system.    
The arguments are optional and specify archive members to compare.   
If not given, the current working directory is assumed.  

--delete  
Delete from the archive.    
The arguments supply names of the archive members to be removed.  At least one argument must be given.

This option does not operate on compressed archives. There is no short option equivalent.
