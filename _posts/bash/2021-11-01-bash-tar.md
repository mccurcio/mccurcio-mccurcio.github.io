### Extract a tarball to a specific dir

Most basic

-x - Extract, 
-f - Use file (create or extract from file) - should always be the last option otherwise the command will not work.


```
tar xf ball.tar -C /path/to/
```


### [tar Man Page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html)

```
-c, --create
Create a new archive.  Arguments supply the names of the files to be archived.  
Directories are archived recursively, unless the --no-recursion option is given.

-d, --diff, --compare
Find differences between archive and file system.  
The arguments are optional and specify archive members to compare.  
If not given, the current working directory is assumed.

--delete
Delete from the archive.  
The arguments supply names of the archive members to be removed.  At least one argument must be given.

This option does not operate on compressed archives. There is no short option equivalent.

-r, --append
Append files to the end of an archive. Arguments have the same meaning as for -c (--create).

-t, --list
List the contents of an archive.  Arguments are optional.
```
