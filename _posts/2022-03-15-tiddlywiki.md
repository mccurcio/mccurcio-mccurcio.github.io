## A Tiddlywiki, What?

> a *Tiddlywiki* non-linear web notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.

Briefly--

Tiddlywiki (*TW*) is a:

1. note taking, 
2. picture storing,
3. document storing,
4. journaling,
5. search enabled,
6. tag managed,

and an *information-storage-software* written in Javascript used with your web browser. 

- It's a free, and open-source. 

I love it because it can be stored on a thumb drive or ON Google Drive and keeps everything together in one place not multiple markdown (*.md) files. 

- It is my favorite note taking platform.

I will admit that this software has not cured me of keeping notes, pictures, etc, in every hiding place possible, but I am one step closer to storing it in one place.


##  Step 1 - Download A TW

- Download your own *Tiddlywiki* .html 'doc': [Tiddlywiki.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

- Scroll down and to the **GettingStarted** box, & find your operating system and browser type then download an empty version.  

*NOTE: Each browser is different and this will ensure the little things work correctly.*

## Step 2 - Open TW

- Once downloaded, **Click the TW to open it in your browser**.

- Your first note (or Tiddler) should show the *configuration page* called: **'GettingStarted'**.

>A **Tiddler** is a single note or piece of info.

- Add your **Title** & **Subtitle** 

 >Both show on the top-right-hand side.

 - Close the tiddler by using the **X**, 
 
 - Then SAVE your .html document by pressing the RED checkmark

## Step #3 - Write a Note

After changing the titles, start writing immediately.

- Press the **Grey Plus Sign** below your titles, to start your first note ([Tiddler](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Tiddlers.html)).

## Step #4 - Write In A Type Of Markdown

This new Tiddler window has 4 areas that are the most useful and (in my mind) the most useful parts are:

1. The Title,
1. The Tag Name,
1. The Text Editor,
1. The Control Buttons (trash-can, x and the chekmark)

>NOTE: Tiddlywiki uses its own variation of Markdown so to begin use the Editor tools to help you used to the changes.

Once you have written you title, note, and chosen a good tag name, 

- Use the Grey Checkmark to accept your note.

- Use the RED checkmark on the far-right and save your work.

> If you make a mistake, use the trash-can to delete it.

**Those are the basics**. Now you are ready to dive in to learn more.
