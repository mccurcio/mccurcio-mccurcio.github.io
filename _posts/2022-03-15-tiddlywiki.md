### What is Tiddlywiki?

Tiddlywiki describes itself as 

> a non-linear web notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.

Tiddlywiki is software written in Javascript that is used with your web browser similar to  a personal wiki server. 

- More simply, it is a free product that can be used for note taking with features such as indexing, searching, saving small pictures or even PDF files together.

When I came across Tiddlywiki, I was using multiple Word docs, multiple text files, multiple folders on my computer, Dropbox, thumb-drives and even GDrive to keep notes. 

I will admit that this software has not cured me of keeping notes, pictures, etc, in every hiding place possible, but I am one step closer to storing it in one place.
