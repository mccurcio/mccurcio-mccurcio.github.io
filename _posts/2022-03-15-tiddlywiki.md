### What is Tiddlywiki?

The *Tiddlywiki* website describes itself as 

> a non-linear web notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.
>
>[Tiddlywiki.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

Tiddlywiki is a:

1. note taking, 
2. picture storing,
3. document storing,
4. journaling,
5. search enabled,
6. tag managed,
7. information storing 

software written in Javascript used with your web browser. 

- It is a free, and open-source product that can be stored on your own computer a thumb-drive or even Goggle's GDrive.

I will admit that this software has not cured me of keeping notes, pictures, etc, in every hiding place possible, but I am one step closer to storing it in one place.


### Step #1

- **Download your own *Tiddlywiki* .html doc**: [Tiddlywiki.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

- Scroll down and to the **GettingStarted** box, & find your operating system and browser type.  

*Each browser is different and this will ensure the little things work correctly.*

### Step #2

- Once you download *Tiddlywiki*, **click to open it in your browser**.

- Your first *.html* page should show the configuration section called **'GettingStarted'**.

- The simplest way to start is by adding your own titles and sub-titles.

- It's that easy.
