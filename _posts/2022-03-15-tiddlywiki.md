### What is Tiddlywiki?

The *Tiddlywiki* website describes itself as 

> a non-linear web notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.
>
>[Tiddlywiki.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

Tiddlywiki is a:

1. note taking, 
2. picture storing,
3. document storing,
4. journaling,
5. search enabled,
6. tag managed,
7. information storing 

software written in Javascript used with your web browser. 

- It is a free, and open-source product that can be stored on your own computer a thumb-drive or even Goggle's GDrive.

I will admit that this software has not cured me of keeping notes, pictures, etc, in every hiding place possible, but I am one step closer to storing it in one place.


### Step #1 - Download TW

- **Download your own *Tiddlywiki* .html doc**: [Tiddlywiki.com](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

- Scroll down and to the **GettingStarted** box, & find your operating system and browser type.  

*Each browser is different and this will ensure the little things work correctly.*

### Step #2 - Open TW

- Once you download *Tiddlywiki*, **click to open it in your browser**.

- Your first *.html* page should show the configuration section called **'GettingStarted'**.

The simplest way to start is by adding your:

 1. Title of your new doc,
 2. Subtitle 

 That both show on the right-hand side.

### Step #3 - Write a Note

After changing the Titles, you can start writing immediately.

- To open your first Note ([Tiddler](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Tiddlers.html)), use the **Grey Plus Sign** below your new titles. 

This will open a blank tiddler.

#### Step #4 - Write with Markdown/HTML/CSS.


This New Tiddle window has 4 areas that are the most useful and (in my mind) the most useful parts are:

1. The Note Title,
1. The Tag Name,
1. The Text Editor,
1. The Control Buttons (trash can, x and the grey chekmark) on the top-left

>I will add that Tiddlywiki uses its own variation of Markdown so to begin use the Editor tools to help you used to the chages.

Once you have written you title, note, and chosen a good tag name, **use the Grey Checkmark to accept your Note**.

*Obviously, the trash can will delete your note if you find that necesary.*
