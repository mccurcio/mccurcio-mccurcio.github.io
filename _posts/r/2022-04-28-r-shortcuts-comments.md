tags: R

- **[Super] + [Shift] + [C] on Linux**

- **[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [C] on Windows**

This shortcut can be used both for:

- R code when you want to comment your code. It will add a **#** at the beginning of the line
- for text in R Markdown. It will add **<!-- and -->** around the text

Note that if you want to comment more than one line, select all the lines you want to comment then use the shortcut. 

To uncomment:  apply **[Super] + [Shift] + [C]** Again!
