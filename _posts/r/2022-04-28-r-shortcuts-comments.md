- **[super] + [Shift] + [C] on Linux**

- **[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [C] on Windows**

This shortcut can be used both for:

- R code when you want to comment your code. It will add a **#** at the beginning of the line
- for text in R Markdown. It will add **<!-- and -->** around the text

Note that if you want to comment more than one line, select all the lines you want to comment then use the shortcut. 

If you want to uncomment a comment, apply the same shortcut.
