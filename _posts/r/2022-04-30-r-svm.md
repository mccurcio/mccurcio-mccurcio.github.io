SVM-Linear Training Model With Tuning

```{r}
set.seed(1000)
start_time <- Sys.time() # Start timer

# tuneGrid = svmLinearGrid
svmLinearGrid <- expand.grid(C = c(2^(4.5), 2^5, 2^(5.5)))

# Create model, 10X fold CV repeated 5X
tcontrol <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                         number = 10,
                         repeats = 5,
                         savePredictions = "final") # Saves predictions

lin_model_obj <- train(Class ~ .,
                       data = training_set,
                       method = "svmLinear",
                       trControl = tcontrol,
                       tuneGrid = svmLinearGrid)

Sys.time() - start_time    # End & Display time
