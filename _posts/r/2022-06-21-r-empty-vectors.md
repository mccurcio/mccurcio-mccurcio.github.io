You can use one of the following methods to create an empty vector in R:

#create empty vector with length zero and no specific class
empty_vec <- vector()

#create empty vector with length zero and a specific class
empty_vec <- numeric()

#create empty vector with specific length
empty_vec <- rep(0, times=10)
