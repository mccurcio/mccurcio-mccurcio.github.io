Check For Anagrams

- This has to be the easiest way ever to check for anagram.

This ditti imports the `collections` library and uses sets.

```
from collections import Counter
def is_anagram(word1, word2):
    """Checks whether the words are anagrams.
    word1: string
    word2: string
    returns: boolean
    """
    return Counter(str1) == Counter(str2) 
```
