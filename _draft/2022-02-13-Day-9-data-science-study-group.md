I spent most of the entire day working on a GitHub site for my Data Science Study Group.

I placed several ads on 3 or 4 Slack channels looking for study buddies and got several hits. I need to contact them!

So, In anticipation of finding a group, I put together a group markdown site for GitHub.

[The Data-Science-Study-Group](https://github.com/mccurcio/Data-Science-Study-Group).
