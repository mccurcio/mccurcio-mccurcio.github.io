I am working on an article that discusses Principal Component Analysis. Here is a sneak-peak.

Principal components analysis is a valuable tool for revealing hidden structure in a dataset with many features/variables. By using PCA, one may be able to:

# Identify which variables are important and shape the dynamics of a system

# Reduce the dimensionality of the data

# Maximize the variance that lies hidden in a dataset and rank them

# Filter noise from data

# Compress the data

# Preprocess data for further analysis or model building.
