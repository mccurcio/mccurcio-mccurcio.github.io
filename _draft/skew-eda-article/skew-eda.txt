## What is wrong with your data?
-->

I was discussing Data Science with a journalist the other day, and a question came up. 

How do Boxplots tie into the bigger picture with respect to Exploratory Data Analysis?

Boxplots and Histograms are the first tools usually taught when learning statistical software, but why? Many online-courses, I've seen gloss over the "WHY."

Since this discussion started by a journalist, I was reminded of the 5 W's of reporting:

1. Who 
2. What
3. When 
4. Where 
5. Why 

- How might a journalist use the five W's when analyzing a dataset?

- Can these five questions be useful when carrying out a Data Analysis? 

In short, **Yes**. 

**And**, I believe the five W's should be asked by Data Scientists too.

Here’s how!

1. **Who** gathered this data?  
 
- Is it important what prejudices, blind-spots, strengths or limitations that person or group had collecting the data?
- As a statistician, we may call this Bias? 
2. **What** questions were the researchers looking to answer?

- What is capable of being investigated by using their dataset.
- Are the questions making correlations, making inferences, even making predictions?
- What are they?

3 & 4. When and Where, We will tackle these together.

- *When** and **Where** was the data collected?
- Where - If a political poll is asked in 2 cities, is it reasonable to assume that the entire country will poll the same way?
- When - Could the time of day? day of the week? or season of the year change the data collected?
- Better yet, When was the data collected? How old is the data?  Does the data have references? Can it replicated?

- And finally,


- **Why** is this data being analyzed?
   - Are you hypothesis testing?
   - Are we looking for a correlation or a regression line?  
- Is the data normally distributed?
- As a statistician, are you concerned about 


What do these examples of asking the five W's have in common? In my mind, they all dive deep into the story or (in this case) the data bias.





>Bias - Inclined to one side; swelled on one side; an inclination; to give a particular direction to; to influence; to prejudice; to prepossess.
>
>Webster, 1913

I believe the five W's are a good way to focus ones skepticism. The five W's give a roadmap that scientists can use too. 

- Is there anything wrong with your data?
- What is its source?
- Who or what compiles your data?
- Where and when was it generated?
- As Data Scientists, can we understand where biases can be introduced?


#### Why does a Data Science need to understand bias?

In much of the world of scientific research, people study the simplest, smallest pieces. Cell biologists design experiments based a single cell type. This reductionist approach is common is science. 

But what happens when people are studied? What happens when a political poll is asked of a number of people in *two cities*. Can that poll be generalized to include everyone in that county, state, and country?

Exploratory Data Analysis is the first review of your data and information. 

EDA is a first attempt to investigate what is right and wrong with your dataset.

There are two types of bias.

1. Conscious Bias
1. Unconscious Bias, also called implicit bias


>Bias: Favorable or unfavorable attitudes, or beliefs about a group [or subject] that informs how we perceive, interact, behave toward the group that are automatically activated.

Unconscious bias 

>In an unbiased random sample, every case in the population should have an equal likelihood of being part of the sample.

#### Sampling Bias

If we think of a political poll, the study should have about the same fraction (percent, proportion, ratio) of college educated vs non-college educated volunteers. If the poll is carried out at a high school will we find the same percent of college-educated versus non-educated in a school of 13-18 year-olds and only several dozen teachers?

3 Ways to Avoid Sampling Bias: 

1. Consider sample size. 
   - Having a *"large"* pool could provide enough randomness in your study to smooth out problems. How much is *"large"*? Good question.  

2. Define a target population.
   - Make online surveys as short and accessible as possible.
   - Follow up with non-responders.
   - Avoid convenience sampling.


Bias in Assignment

Assignment bias can also be called selection bias. 

Pretend you are a teacher. You ask for student volunteers to check the spelling or grammar of several papers. Ask your yourself, will this teacher find the students with an average grammar or spelling skills? Probably not. In most studies the 'volunteers' are themselves chosen from select groups that have a similar ratio English majors as Chemistry majors as in the school population.
