Boxplots and Histograms are the first tools taught with statistical software, but why? Many courses gloss over the "why" assuming everyone knows the answer.

Since my discussion was with a journalist, I was reminded of the 5 W's of reporting:

1. Who 
2. What
3. When 
4. Where 
5. Why 

- How might a journalist think of the 5 W's when analyzing a dataset. 

- Can these 5 questions be useful when carrying out a Data Analysis? 

In short, **Yes**. 

**And**, they should be asked by Data Scientists too.

- **Why** did your research come to find this result? 
    - Why is this data being analyzed at all?
    - Are we hypothesis testing?
    - Are we looking for a correlation or a regression line?  
    - Is the data normally distributed?  
</br>

- **When** and **Where** was the data collected?
    - If a political poll is asked in 2 cities, is it reasonable to assume that you can apply 'your poll' to the entire country?
    - Could the time, day, or season the data was collected change over time?  
</br>
   
- Is it important, **Who** gathered this data?  
    - What prejudices did that person or group have while collecting the data?   
</br>
   
- And finally, **What** can be learned from the dataset?

Jeff Leek and Roger Peng have their angle on Data Science, 'What is the Question?'

![](jleek-ds.png)

In the flowchart above, Data Science and Statistics can be broken down into 6 categories.
 In this article, I will be focusing on Exploraotry Data Analysis (EDA).
 
 
1. Descriptive Statistics - simply describe the circumstances

- Circumstance #1: A statistician may find themselves working in a manufacturing department within a company making electronic boards. The statistician may be part of a 'Process-Control' team. 
- If you are measuring the voltages of the boards on an assembly line your job could be to sample a number of boards and find what percentage are in/out of specification. For example: Sampling 40 boards gives:

| Descriptive Statistic | Value      |
| :-------------------- | :--------- |
| n                     | 40         |
| mean                  | 3.12 Volts |
| meadian               | 3.5 Volts  |
| mode                  | 3.4 Volts  |
| standard deviation    | 0.25 Volts |


1. Exploratory
1. Inferential
1. Predictive
2. Causual
1. Mechanistic

Commonly, the first topic in statistics classes is to discuss where bias can be introduced into a study.

- What is wrong with the data?
- Is there anything wrong with your study?
- Is it possible to fix the study or data?
- Can the mistake even be fixed?

Exploratory Data Analysis is the first review of your data and information. 

<!-- 
Conversely, can Data Scientists learn from Journalists? Are Data Scientists acting similarly to investigative reporters, who look for problems with the goal being to bring a story to light?
-->

I plan to investigate two mathematical perturbations that can be interpreted using Boxplots and Histograms. Two common measures for distributions are skew and kurtosis.


>Perturbation, in mathematics, a method for solving a problem by comparing it with a similar one for which the solution is known. Usually the solution found in this way is only approximate.

But first, let us prepare some good and bad data.

#### Generate a dataset
```{r}
# Create data
names <- c(rep("A", 15) , rep("B", 15) , rep("C", 15))
value <- c( rpois(15, 5) , rnorm(15, mean=10, sd=15) , rnorm(15, mean=40, sd=10) )
data <- data.frame(names,value)

boxplot(data$value ~ data$names , col=terrain.colors(4), horizontal = T )
```


Square Values
```{r}
skewed_1 = (1/2)*(data$value)^2
data <- cbind(data, skewed_1)

boxplot(data$skewed_1 ~ data$names , col=terrain.colors(4), horizontal = T )
```
