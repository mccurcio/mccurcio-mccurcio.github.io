### Company Notes: Investigating alwaysAI

Date: 5/10/21

### Executive Summary:

- alwaysAI (aai) is a startup out of San Diego, CA that helps developers quickly get edge devices (IOT)  started and deployed quickly using open-source AI models (for example [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to assist companies with machine learning tasks such as:

1. image classification
2. object detection
3. object tracking
4. tracking & counting
5. semantic segmentation
6. pose estimation

- edge deployment is better than cloud deployment, inference on the edge with pre-made models is quicker than on the cloud.
- What is **Projects & Teams**? This is on road-map as of July 2020.
- Benefits of working with aai is that they have trained “increasingly” scarce computer vision programmers.


#### First saw Manu Dwivedi presentation
- Temperature checking for patients in hospital, Danbery, ct.
-Computer Vision Improves COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution
- Wait Time - id people waiting and count how long wait time is
- Analytics - determine how many vials have bee used, how many vaccinated
- post inoculation - look adverse side effects from sick people

#### Interesting white paper by Komal Devjani
- [Advantages of Implementing CV on the Edge](https://learn.alwaysai.co/hubfs/alwaysAI_whitepaper.pdf)

#### aai partnered with 
- [Nvidia Jetson Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/)
- qualcomm
- arm
- balena; helpful with fleet deployment of iot
- twilio; voice and sms communication abilities

#### Three Steps for deployment:
1. model building 
  - made easier
  - ~60 models for quick spin-up
  - ~12 models pre-trained
 2. API libraries 
   - customize app development
 3. deploy and run edge devices - arm, raspberry pi, Jetson Nano, etc

#### aai has a training toolkit
1. data collection can be done ON edge device
2. data annotation is made easy with [Computer Vision Annotation Tool](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat).
4. transfer learning-model training capabilities, train model and tweek it

**Benefits**: Code free, train on your local machine, cpu or gpu for real-time feedback, FREE acts available for easy development.
