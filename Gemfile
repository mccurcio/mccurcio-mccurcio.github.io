ruby RUBY_VERSION

# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.

# gem "jekyll", "4.2.2" # Careful GitHub uses 3.9

#Set up your project gems. 
# Note that the Kramdown parse must be installed explicitly in Jekyll 3.9
# (but no 3.8 or 4.x).

gem "jekyll", "~> 3"
gem "kramdown-parser-gfm", "~> 1.1"

#Both Method#1 & 2 work well with Ubuntu based systems.

#Method #1 
# Then run: 
#bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle
#bundle install

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. 
# You may change this to anything you like.
# gem "minima"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. 

#Method #2 
### To upgrade, run:
#bundle update github-pages
#gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
# group :jekyll_plugins do
#   gem "jekyll-github-metadata", "~> 1.0"
# end
